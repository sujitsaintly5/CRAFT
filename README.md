### Custom Reconnaissance Automation Framework for Offensive Security

ReconX is a modular, decision-driven reconnaissance automation framework designed for offensive security, penetration testing, and bug bounty reconnaissance.

Unlike traditional recon scripts that simply aggregate tool output, ReconX focuses on attack surface prioritization — helping security testers decide where to spend their limited manual testing time.

## 🎯 Why ReconX Exists
### Most recon tools answer:
```
“What assets exist?”
```
### ReconX answers:
```
“Which assets matter the most to attack?”
```

### In real-world offensive security:

 1. Time is limited

 2. Noise is high

 3. Blind scanning wastes effort

### ReconX reduces noise by:

 1. Correlating recon data

 2. Penalizing low-signal hosts

 3. Prioritizing high-risk attack surfaces

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
### ReconX follows real attacker methodology:

 1. Discover attack surface

 2. Validate what is actually reachable

 3. Understand technology context

 4. Identify high-value endpoints

 5. Map known vulnerability signals

 6. Prioritize targets using risk heuristics

 7. Hand off results to manual testing

❌ No auto-exploitation
❌ No brute forcing
❌ No weaponized payloads

✔ Ethical
✔ Practical
✔ Realistic
