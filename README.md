### Custom Reconnaissance Automation Framework for Offensive Security

ReconX is a modular, decision-driven reconnaissance automation framework designed for offensive security, penetration testing, and bug bounty reconnaissance.

Unlike traditional recon scripts that simply aggregate tool output, ReconX focuses on attack surface prioritization — helping security testers decide where to spend their limited manual testing time.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool is intended ONLY for authorized security testing, educational labs, and bug bounty programs where you have explicit permission.

## 🎯 Why ReconX Exists
Most recon tools answer:
```
“What assets exist?”
```
ReconX answers:
```
“Which assets matter the most to attack?”
```

In real-world offensive security:

Time is limited

Noise is high

Blind scanning wastes effort

ReconX reduces noise by:

Correlating recon data

Penalizing low-signal hosts

Prioritizing high-risk attack surfaces
