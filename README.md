### Custom Reconnaissance Automation Framework for Offensive Security

ReconX is a modular, decision-driven reconnaissance automation framework designed for offensive security, penetration testing, and bug bounty reconnaissance.

Unlike traditional recon scripts that simply aggregate tool output, ReconX focuses on attack surface prioritization — helping security testers decide where to spend their limited manual testing time.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool is intended ONLY for authorized security testing, educational labs, and bug bounty programs where you have explicit permission.
The author is not responsible for misuse.

## 🎯 Why ReconX Exists
### Most recon tools answer:
```
“What assets exist?”
```
### ReconX answers:
```
“Which assets matter the most to attack?”
```

### In real-world offensive security:

 1. Time is limited
 2. Noise is high
 3. Blind scanning wastes effort

### ReconX reduces noise by:

 1. Correlating recon data
 2. Penalizing low-signal hosts
 3. Prioritizing high-risk attack surfaces

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
### ReconX follows real attacker methodology:

 1. Discover attack surface
 2. Validate what is actually reachable
 3. Understand technology context
 4. Identify high-value endpoints
 5. Map known vulnerability signals
 6. Prioritize targets using risk heuristics
 7. Hand off results to manual testing

 - ❌ No auto-exploitation
 - ❌ No brute forcing
 - ❌ No weaponized payloads

 - ✔ Ethical
 - ✔ Practical
 - ✔ Realistic

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reconx.git
cd reconx
```
### 2️⃣ Install System Dependencies

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y subfinder amass httpx nuclei golang
```

```
subfinder -h
amass -h
httpx -h
gau -h
nuclei -version
```
### 3️⃣ Python Environment (Recommended)

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## ▶️ Usage
### Basic Recon
```
python recon.py example.com
```
ReconX will:
 1. Discover subdomains
 2. Validate live hosts
 3. Extract technologies
 4. Identify interesting endpoints
 5. Map vulnerability signals
 6. Generate prioritized reports

## 📊 Output Explained
``` output/report.json ```
Machine-readable output for:
 1. Further automation
 2. Integration with other tools
 3. Data analysis

``` output/report.md ```
Human-readable report optimized for:
 1. Manual testing
 2. Bug bounty workflows
 3. Pentest planning

Each host includes:
 1. Risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
 2. Risk score
 3. Technology stack
 4. Integrating endpoints
 5. Vulnerability signals

## 🔥 How Bug Hunters Use ReconX
1. Run recon on target scope
2. Sort by HIGH risk
3. Manually test:
 - Authentication flows
 - IDORs
 - File uploads
 - API logic
4. Ignore LOW risk noise
5. Write high-quality reports
